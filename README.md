## TicTacToe


I created a Tic Tac Toe app using Swift UiKit that delivers a contemporary and user-friendly interface. It's an engaging experience with its simple yet intuitive design, and it's perfect for players of all ages to enjoy the classic game of strategy right on their iOS devices. I continued to develop on writing UILabels and UIButtons progromatically, setting constraints, and overall gained experience not depending on main to use simple but essential functionalities to create apps.
